Mahalo is a pure Java implementation of mDNS and DNS-SD, based off of the draft-cheshire-dnsext-multicastdns.txt and draft-cheshire-dnsext-dns-sd.txt documents.  It has been tested with Apple's Bonjour service and seems to work, though it has not gone through Bonjour certification.

Mahalo is tangentially based off of the [JmDNS project](http://jmdns.sourceforge.net/).
